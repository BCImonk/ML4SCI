# Data Classification: Codes Comparison

## Basic Classification

The basic approach was designed as an initial exploration of EEG classification using standard machine learning techniques. The goal was to establish a baseline performance for comparison with more advanced methods, focusing on dimensionality reduction through PCA and straightforward application of common classification algorithms.

### Architecture of the Code
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Standard normalization using `StandardScaler`
  - PCA dimensionality reduction (reducing from 320 to 20 features while preserving 98.94% of variance)
- **Models Implemented**:
  - Linear Regression (applied to classification by rounding)
  - SVM with different kernels (linear, RBF, polynomial)
  - KNN with different values (k=3 and k=5)
- **Evaluation Method**: 
  - 5-fold stratified cross-validation
  - Performance metrics: accuracy and precision
  - Runtime comparison

### Performance
- Best performing model: **SVM with polynomial kernel**
- Accuracy: **0.4750 ± 0.0500**
- Precision: **0.2929 ± 0.1045**
- The overall performance is modest, with most models achieving less than 50% accuracy

### Drawbacks and Scope for Improvements
- Does not leverage EEG-specific domain knowledge
- No feature engineering based on neurophysiological insights
- Limited hyperparameter tuning
- No data augmentation techniques
- Performance is better than random but still insufficient for practical applications
- Future improvements could include specialized feature extraction, topological information incorporation, and more advanced model architectures

## Advanced Classification

The advanced approach was developed with the understanding that EEG data has specific characteristics that can be leveraged through domain knowledge. It was conceived to address the limitations of the basic approach by incorporating neurophysiological insights, extensive feature engineering, and sophisticated preprocessing techniques.

### Architecture of the Code
- **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing**:
  - Multiple preprocessing techniques (StandardScaler, PowerTransformer, RobustScaler)
  - Various feature selection methods (PCA, SelectKBest, RFECV)
- **Extensive Feature Engineering**:
  - Region-based features (frontal, central, parietal, temporal, occipital)
  - Hemisphere-based features (left vs. right)
  - Channel group analysis (frontal_midline, central_midline, etc.)
  - Statistical features (mean, std, max, min, skew, kurtosis)
  - Band power ratios between frequency bands
  - Asymmetry measures between hemispheres
  - Differential entropy calculations
- **Data Augmentation**:
  - Creation of synthetic samples to expand the dataset
- **Advanced Model Implementation**:
  - Logistic Regression with optimized parameters
  - SVM with multiple kernels and parameter tuning
  - KNN with various distance metrics
  - Ensemble voting classifier combining the best models
- **Evaluation Method**:
  - Stratified cross-validation
  - Comprehensive metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

### Advantages over the Previous Model
- Leverages domain-specific knowledge of EEG data
- Incorporates spatial relationships between EEG channels
- Uses frequency band interactions that have neurophysiological significance
- Implements data augmentation to address the small dataset challenge
- Creates an ensemble of best-performing models
- Applies optimized feature selection for each preprocessing method

### Performance
- Best model: **SVM with linear kernel using RFE preprocessing**
- Accuracy on augmented data: **0.9786**
- Accuracy on original data: **0.7000**
- Ensemble model accuracy: **0.9786**
- Significant performance improvement over the basic approach (from ~48% to ~70% on original data)

### Drawbacks and Scope for Improvements
- High complexity may lead to overfitting, especially with the synthetic data
- Computational intensity makes it less suitable for real-time applications
- Risk of data leakage in the feature engineering process
- Limited interpretability due to complex feature transformations
- Future improvements could include:
  - Deep learning approaches (CNNs, RNNs) for automatic feature extraction
  - Transfer learning from larger EEG datasets
  - Temporal information incorporation
  - Explainable AI techniques to improve interpretability
  - Cross-subject validation to test generalizability
